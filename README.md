RustPlay

A playground and starter kit in Rust for experimentation, learning, and rapid prototyping.

ðŸš€ What is RustPlay?

RustPlay is a lightweight Rust project designed to serve as your go-to sandbox for testing ideas, writing small utilities, or exploring Rust libraries and patterns. Whether youâ€™re just getting started with Rust or you want a minimal base to build from, this repo gives you a clean, ready-to-go structure.

ðŸŽ¯ Why use RustPlay?

Clean setup: Comes with Cargo.toml, src/ folder and baseline config so you can dive in right away.

Focus on code: No heavy scaffolding or complex architecture â€” just Rust and your ideas.

Learning-friendly: Ideal for trying out new crates, writing experiments, or creating small tools.

Flexible: You can extend it into a CLI, a library, a web service, or whatever your next Rust project may become.

ðŸ“¦ Features

Pure Rust (100 %) codebase.

Standard Cargo project structure: src/main.rs, etc.

Git-ignorance for lockfiles included (.gitignore).

Ready to build and run with cargo build / cargo run.

ðŸ§ª Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/nikolascatur/RustPlay.git
cd RustPlay


Build the project:

cargo build


Run it:

cargo run


Modify src/main.rs (or add modules) and start experimenting with Rust!

ðŸ”§ Extend It

Here are a few ideas for where you might go next:

Add a library module in src/lib.rs and expose public APIs.

Build a CLI tool using the clap
 crate.

Write tests in tests/ or src/ using Rustâ€™s #[test] infrastructure.

Integrate async features with tokio
 or async-std
.

Package the code as a library and publish on crates.io
 (if you like).

ðŸ§  Why I Created This

I built RustPlay to have a minimal, no-frills Rust project I could open anytime â€” whether Iâ€™m cluttering it with experiments, learning a new crate, or building a small tool. It keeps the boilerplate low and the fun high.
